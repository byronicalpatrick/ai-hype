# AI HYPE

The AI hype is **strong**. We want an indicator of how strong, as measured by the number of the latest "Show HN" posts on Hacker News which involve AI. This seems like a good indicator of how many people are developing tools/features/platforms using "AI". This number is passed through a sigmoid function so it effectively saturates at 50% of Hacker News posts, because that ratio is wild and it makes the dial look more _extreme_.

Note: this is just a hueristic measure, the formula is made up to look good!
