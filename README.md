# AI HYPE

The AI hype is **strong**. We want an indicator of how strong, as measured by the number of the latest "Show HN" posts on Hacker News which involve AI. This seems like a good indicator of how many people are developing tools/features/platforms using "AI". This number is passed through a sigmoid function so it effectively saturates at 50% of new "Show HN" posts, because that ratio is wild and it makes the dial look more _extreme_.

This is just a heuristic, the formula is made up to look good! This page makes no claim about whether the hype is real or not.
